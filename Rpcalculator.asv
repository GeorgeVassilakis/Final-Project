function [Rplanet] = Rpcalculator(Rstar,Depth)
%Rcalculator function calculates the radius of a planet in miles, when
%given: Rstar (Radius of star in terms of solar radius)
%given: Depth (Depth of l
Rplanet = (Rstar).*(432690).*sqrt(Depth)
% Rstar is a proportion radius of our home star, so multiplying the Rstar
% by the radius of the sun in miles will give Rplanet in miles
